    <p>Cooking (and savoring) is pure joy. From sunny picnics with crispy focaccia to cozy risotto on chilly days, each
      dish holds its own magic. And it gets even better when you're the magician.</p>
    <p>Here, you'll find my favorite recipes—tried, tested, and heartily enjoyed. I didn't invent them, but I've crafted

        <h3>Focaccia</h3>
      </header>

      <section>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>7g Active dry yeast</li>
          <li>780g Bread flour</li>
          <li>17g Salt</li>
          <li>¾ Cup Olive Oil</li>
          <li>Water</li>
          <li>Toppings (for example, rosemary, garlic & red pepper flakes)</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk 7g dry yeast with ½ cup warm water. Let sit for five minutes.</li>
          <li>After five minutes add 2 ½ cups of room temperature water, 780g sifted bread flour and 17g salt. Mix to
            incorporate the water with the flour (about five minutes). Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a damp, clean
            kitchen cloth. Let the dough rest for ten minutes.</li>
          <li>After ten minutes, mix / knead until the dough becomes very smooth and elastic (about 15 minutes with a
            mixer or 30 minutes if mixing by hand). Bread is more about feel than time.</li>
          <li>After mixing, pour ¼ cup olive oil into the bowl to cover the entire dough (including the bottom). Cover
            the bowl again with plastic wrap or towel, let the dough rest for 1 ½ - 2 hours. Dough should roughly double
            in size. Remember, bread is more about feel than time.</li>
          <li>Poke test the dough for readiness. Stick a finger into the dough. It should not immediately close up and
            instead roughly maintain its form.</li>
          <li>Oil a baking sheet tray with ¼ cup olive oil. Before transferring dough to a sheet tray, perform four
            quarter folds. Then, add dough to the sheet tray and gently stretch it to fill the tray. Cover with plastic
            wrap and let it rest for 10-15 minutes.</li>
          <li>Prepare toppings, mix with ¼ cup olive oil. For example, slice garlic and rosemary and marinate in olive
            oil with red pepper flakes.</li>
          <li>Remove plastic wrap and finish stretching dough into corners of sheet tray. Cover again with plastic wrap,
            let the dough rest in the refrigerator for 8-12 hours (overnight is great).</li>
          <li>After letting the dough rest, prepare for baking. Preheat the oven to 450 F. Remove dough from fridge,
            dimple the dough as if playing the piano to remove air bubbles. Apply toppings. Sprinkle coarse salt.</li>
          <li>After letting the oven preheat for thirty minutes, bake focaccia on the middle rack for 20 minutes. After
            twenty minutes, move the focaccia to the top rack and bake for another five minutes or until golden.</li>
          <li>Remove from the oven, let cool on a wire rack. Enjoy!</li>

      <section>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Neutral Oil</li>
          <li>3 Medium Eggplants</li>
          <li>Salt</li>
          <li>¼ Cup Tahini Paste</li>
          <li>¼ Cup Lemon Juice</li>
          <li>4 Garlic Cloves</li>
          <li>⅛ Teaspoon Cayenne Pepper</li>
          <li>½ Teaspoon Toasted Cumin seeds</li>
          <li>3 Tablespoons Olive Oil</li>

      <section>
        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Prepare a charcoal grill. Pierce eggplants here and there with a fork. Place into hot coals, allow skins to blister and char, turning with tongs until the entire surface is blackened and eggplants are completely soft. Set aside to cool.</li>
          <li>Halve eggplants lengthwise and carefully scrape away flesh. Discard skin and place flesh into a colander. Salt lightly and leave for ten minutes. Then, squeeze into a ball to remove liquid.</li>
          <li>Blend eggplant, ½ teaspoon salt, tahini, lemon juice, garlic and cayenne to obtain a creamy puree (alternatively, you can simply whisk for a more rustic spread). Taste, adjust seasonings to your preference. Transfer to a shallow serving bowl.</li>
          <li>Sprinkle cumin seeds, paprika, parsley, mint and olive oil on top. Serve with warm pita bread. Enjoy!</li>
