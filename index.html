        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk 7g dry yeast with ½ cup warm water. Let sit for five minutes.</li>
          <li>After five minutes add 2 ½ cups of room temperature water, 780g sifted bread flour and 17g salt. Mix to
            incorporate the water with the flour (about five minutes). Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a damp, clean
            kitchen cloth. Let the dough rest for ten minutes.</li>
          <li>After ten minutes, mix / knead until the dough becomes very smooth and elastic (about 15 minutes with a
            mixer or 30 minutes if mixing by hand). Bread is more about feel than time.</li>
          <li>After mixing, pour ¼ cup olive oil into the bowl to cover the entire dough (including the bottom). Cover
            the bowl again with plastic wrap or towel, let the dough rest for 1 ½ - 2 hours. Dough should roughly double
            in size. Remember, bread is more about feel than time.</li>
          <li>Poke test the dough for readiness. Stick a finger into the dough. It should not immediately close up and
            instead roughly maintain its form.</li>
          <li>Oil a baking sheet tray with ¼ cup olive oil. Before transferring dough to a sheet tray, perform four
            quarter folds. Then, add dough to the sheet tray and gently stretch it to fill the tray. Cover with plastic
            wrap and let it rest for 10-15 minutes.</li>
          <li>Prepare toppings, mix with ¼ cup olive oil. For example, slice garlic and rosemary and marinate in olive
            oil with red pepper flakes.</li>
          <li>Remove plastic wrap and finish stretching dough into corners of sheet tray. Cover again with plastic wrap,
            let the dough rest in the refrigerator for 8-12 hours (overnight is great).</li>
          <li>After letting the dough rest, prepare for baking. Preheat the oven to 450 F. Remove dough from fridge,
            dimple the dough as if playing the piano to remove air bubbles. Apply toppings. Sprinkle coarse salt.</li>
          <li>After letting the oven preheat for thirty minutes, bake focaccia on the middle rack for 20 minutes. After
            twenty minutes, move the focaccia to the top rack and bake for another five minutes or until golden.</li>
          <li>Remove from the oven, let cool on a wire rack. Enjoy!</li>
