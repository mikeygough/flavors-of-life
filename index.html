        Cooking (and savoring) is pure joy. From sunny picnics with crispy
        focaccia to cozy risotto on chilly days, each dish holds its own magic.
        And it gets even better when you're the magician.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, you'll find my favorite recipes—tried, tested, and heartily
        enjoyed. I didn't invent them, but I've crafted and shared them with
        love. I hope you'll enjoy the flavors of my life.

          <h3>Ingredients</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>7g Active dry yeast</li>
            <li>780g Bread flour</li>
            <li>17g Salt</li>
            <li>¾ Cup Olive Oil</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>
              Toppings (for example, rosemary, garlic &amp; red pepper flakes)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Instructions</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              In a large mixing bowl, whisk 7g dry yeast with ½ cup warm water.
              Let sit for five minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              After five minutes add 2 ½ cups of room temperature water, 780g
              sifted bread flour and 17g salt. Mix to incorporate the water with
              the flour (about five minutes). Cover the bowl with plastic wrap
              or a damp, clean kitchen cloth. Let the dough rest for ten
              minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              After ten minutes, mix / knead until the dough becomes very smooth
              and elastic (about 15 minutes with a mixer or 30 minutes if mixing
              by hand). Bread is more about feel than time.
            </li>
            <li>
              After mixing, pour ¼ cup olive oil into the bowl to cover the
              entire dough (including the bottom). Cover the bowl again with
              plastic wrap or towel, let the dough rest for 1 ½ - 2 hours. Dough
              should roughly double in size. Remember, bread is more about feel
              than time.
            </li>
            <li>
              Poke test the dough for readiness. Stick a finger into the dough.
              It should not immediately close up and instead roughly maintain
              its form.
            </li>
            <li>
              Oil a baking sheet tray with ¼ cup olive oil. Before transferring
              dough to a sheet tray, perform four quarter folds. Then, add dough
              to the sheet tray and gently stretch it to fill the tray. Cover
              with plastic wrap and let it rest for 10-15 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Prepare toppings, mix with ¼ cup olive oil. For example, slice
              garlic and rosemary and marinate in olive oil with red pepper
              flakes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Remove plastic wrap and finish stretching dough into corners of
              sheet tray. Cover again with plastic wrap, let the dough rest in
              the refrigerator for 8-12 hours (overnight is great).
            </li>
            <li>
              After letting the dough rest, prepare for baking. Preheat the oven
              to 450 F. Remove dough from fridge, dimple the dough as if playing
              the piano to remove air bubbles. Apply toppings. Sprinkle coarse
              salt.
            </li>
            <li>
              After letting the oven preheat for thirty minutes, bake focaccia
              on the middle rack for 20 minutes. After twenty minutes, move the
              focaccia to the top rack and bake for another five minutes or
              until golden.
            </li>
            <li>Remove from the oven, let cool on a wire rack. Enjoy!</li>

            <li>
              Heat one tablespoon of oil in a pan. When oil turns hot add green

              Heat oven to 425 F. In a saucepan, heat two tablespoons of oil
              over medium heat. Stir in garlic until fragrant then add soy

            <li>Neutral Oil</li>
            <li>3 Medium Eggplants</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>¼ Cup Tahini Paste</li>
            <li>¼ Cup Lemon Juice</li>
            <li>4 Garlic Cloves</li>
            <li>⅛ Teaspoon Cayenne Pepper</li>
            <li>½ Teaspoon Toasted Cumin seeds</li>
            <li>3 Tablespoons Olive Oil</li>
            <li>½ Teaspoon Paprika</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon Finely Chopped Parsley</li>

          <h3>Instructions</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Prepare a charcoal grill. Pierce eggplants here and there with a
              fork. Place into hot coals, allow skins to blister and char,
              turning with tongs until the entire surface is blackened and
              eggplants are completely soft. Set aside to cool.
            </li>
            <li>
              Halve eggplants lengthwise and carefully scrape away flesh.
              Discard skin and place flesh into a colander. Salt lightly and
              leave for ten minutes. Then, squeeze into a ball to remove liquid.
            </li>
            <li>
              Blend eggplant, ½ teaspoon salt, tahini, lemon juice, garlic and
              cayenne to obtain a creamy puree (alternatively, you can simply
              whisk for a more rustic spread). Taste, adjust seasonings to your
              preference. Transfer to a shallow serving bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sprinkle cumin seeds, paprika, parsley, mint and olive oil on top.
              Serve with warm pita bread. Enjoy!

            <li>Pepper</li>

            <li>½ Cup Dry White Wine or Sake</li>
            <li>1 Cup Frozen Peas</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons Fresh Chopped Parsley</li>

          <h3>Instructions</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Heat two tablespoons of oil in a pan, add shallots and cook until
              just tender (about five minutes).
            </li>
            <li>
              Turn up heat, add mushrooms. Cook, stirring, until they begin to
              sweat then add garlic and thyme / sage. Season with salt and
              pepper. Cook until soft.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add rice and stir until grains begin to crackle. Add wine or sake.
              Cook until liquid is no longer visible. Stir in enough stock to
              just cover the rice. Cook, stirring vigorously until stock is just
              about absorbed. Add another ladle or two of stock and continue
              cooking. Repeat this process for about 15 minutes, cooking down
              stock then adding more.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add peas. Keep adding stock and cooking down for another ten
              minutes. Rice should be getting tender but still al dente.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add another ladle or two of stock, stir in parsley and cheese.
              Remove from heat. Taste, adjust seasonings to your preference.
              Enjoy!
